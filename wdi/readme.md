# Storytelling through Data

This project was focused on telling a story from the data of World Development Indicators which is a huge data repository of the World Bank, covering economic and social statistics of almost all nations/sovereign entities/countries in the world. 
Since I live and work in Pakistan, a country in the region commonly known as South Asia, I focused my analysis on this region. 
And also, I know beforehand that there have been huge shifts in the development stories of the countries that are included in this supranational grouping. Mainly, India and Bangladesh have surged ahead of Pakistan in many respects in the past few decades while Pakistan has been mired in a deep-rooted stagnation which its elites seem to have no way of escaping from. 
In this context, I designed this graphic to show the shifts over time in the socioeconomic and human development indicators in these countries.
